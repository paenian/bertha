Large format Rostock style printer, built with aluminum extrusions.

My plan is to design a large printer, emphasizing quality over cost.  Ideally there will be the 'full' version, and then various lower cost options.

The design of the plastic parts contained her is complete - that's not to say they won't be updated, just that everything in here is functional.

I am working on build instructions in a blog over here: http://berthareprap.blogspot.com/2013/05/mark-4-finally.html
I am currently constructing the very first machine, so instructions are coming out as I get build time.
